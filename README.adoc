== python-yubihsm

Python library and tests for the YubiHSM 2.

The current version (3.0) supports Python 3.8 and later.

Communicates with the YubiHSM 2 connector daemon, which must already be running.
It can also communicate directly with the YubiHSM 2 via USB (requires libusb).

=== Installation

From PyPI:

 $ pip install yubihsm[http,usb]

From a source .tar.gz:

 $ pip install yubihsm-<version>.tar.gz[http,usb]

Omitting a tag from the brackets will install the library without support for
that backend, and will avoid installing unneeded dependencies.

=== Quick reference commands:
[source,python]
----
from yubihsm import YubiHsm
from yubihsm.defs import CAPABILITY, ALGORITHM
from yubihsm.objects import AsymmetricKey

# Connect to the YubiHSM via the connector using the default password:
hsm = YubiHsm.connect('http://localhost:12345')
session = hsm.create_session_derived(1, 'password')

# Generate a private key on the YubiHSM for creating signatures:
key = AsymmetricKey.generate(  # Generate a new key object in the YubiHSM.
    session,                   # Secure YubiHsm session to use.
    0,                         # Object ID, 0 to get one assigned.
    'My key',                  # Label for the object.
    1,                         # Domain(s) for the object.
    CAPABILITY.SIGN_ECDSA,     # Capabilities for the object, can have multiple.
    ALGORITHM.EC_P256          # Algorithm for the key.
)

# pub_key is a cryptography.io ec.PublicKey, see https://cryptography.io
pub_key = key.get_public_key()

# Write the public key to a file:
with open('public_key.pem', 'w') as f:
    f.write(pub_key.public_bytes(
        encoding=serialization.Encoding.PEM,
        format=serialization.PublicFormat.SubjectPublicKeyInfo
    ))

# Sign some data:
signature = key.sign_ecdsa(b'Hello world!')  # Create a signature.

# Clean up:
session.close()
hsm.close()

=== Development
For development of the library, `poetry` is used. To set up the dev
environment, run this command in the root directory of the repository:

 $ poetry install -E http -E usb

==== Pre-commit checks
This project uses https://pre-commit.com to run several checks on the code
prior to committing. To enable the hooks, run this command in the root
directory of the repository:

  $ pre-commit install

Once the hooks are installed, they will run automatically on any changed files
when committing. To run the hooks against all files in the repository, run:

  $ pre-commit run --all-files

==== Running tests
Running the tests require a YubiHSM2 to run against, with the default
authentication key enabled (as is the case after performing a factory reset).

WARNING: The YubiHSM under test will be factory reset by the tests!

 $ poetry run pytest

See pytest documentation for instructions on running a specific test.

By default the tests will connect to a yubihsm-connector running with the
default settings on http://localhost:12345. To change this, use the `--backend`
argument, eg:

 $ poetry run pytest --backend "yhusb://"

Access to the device requires proper permissions, so either use sudo or setup a
udev rule. Sample udev configuration can be found
link:https://developers.yubico.com/YubiHSM2/Component_Reference/yubihsm-connector/[here].

==== Generating HTML documentation

To build the HTML documentation, run:

 $ poetry run make -C docs/ html

The resulting output will be in docs/_build/html/.

==== Source releases for distribution
Build a source release:

 $ poetry build

The resulting .tar.gz and .whl will be created in `dist/`.
